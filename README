The library consists of two parts:
	* pseudo-terminal handling (as in "vt100-like", not in "pty")
	  These parts are documented in "man vt100".
	* ttyrec files
	  For documentation, look at "man libtty".

The utilities are:
	* termrec
	* termplay
	* proxyrec
	* termtime
	* termcat

	junk from the Affero branch.
