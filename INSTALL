For the Unix port (that is, the parts that are done), do:
    + apt-get install libz-dev libbz2-dev
       Or equivalent.  If you skip this step, the .gz/.bz2 support will
       simply be skipped.
    + ./configure
    + make

At this moment, only the Win32 version is working.
To compile it, you need a way to run the GNU configure.  It can be done by:

* getting MinGW and MSYS
    + download them from http://mingw.org
    + ./configure
    + make
    
* using CygWin
    for cygwin:
    + ./configure
    + make
    
    for mingw:
    + CC=/cygdrive/c/MinGW/bin/gcc ./configure
    + make

* cross-compiling from an Unix platform
    + CC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc ./configure --host i586-mingw32msvc
    + make


For the compression plugins, you'll need to grab zlib and/or libbz2.  If
you're putting them together by hand, put the files as:
* zlib:
    + lib/zconf.h
    + lib/zlib.h
    + lib/libz.a
* bzlib:
    + lib/bzlib.h
    + lib/libbz2.a
