* Fixed a race condition in termplay/win32 that often caused crashes if the
  file to replay was specified on the command line.
* Done proxyrec/unix -- it's untested on anything but Debian/unstable/i386,
  though.
* Made some preliminary code for termrec/unix.  It's still buggy like if it
  was done by Microsoft, though (ok, well, perhaps I'm exaggerating).
